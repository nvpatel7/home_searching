# Real Estate Analysis and Image Scraping Projects

This repository contains two distinct projects aimed at leveraging data from Zillow for real estate analysis and image extraction. Each project uses a different set of tools and techniques to achieve its objectives.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Home Purchase Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing potential home purchases using data scraped from Zillow. The analysis utilizes a combination of Tableau, PostgreSQL, and Python to provide insights into real estate trends, pricing, and other key factors that influence buying decisions.

- **Tools and Technologies Used:**
  - **Tableau:** For visualizing real estate data and uncovering trends.
  - **PostgreSQL:** For storing, managing, and querying the data scraped from Zillow.
  - **Python:** For data extraction and preprocessing, utilizing libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

### 2. Zillow Listing Image Scraper

The second project involves scraping images from Zillow listings. It is implemented using Python with Selenium and BeautifulSoup, enabling automated extraction of property images directly from Zillow pages.

- **Tools and Technologies Used:**
  - **Python:** The primary programming language used for the scraper.
  - **Selenium:** For automating web browser interaction to access dynamic content.
  - **BeautifulSoup:** For parsing HTML content to locate and download images.

## How to Execute

To run any of the projects, navigate to the project directory and execute the relevant Python script:
